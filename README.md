# CPSC 3620 Sliding Tiles Project
# Name: Blake McLachlin

# Instructions for compiling and running the program:

# To create the executable, type make. This will create an executable called solver, which you can then run on a computer machine.
# When you run the executable, the program will ask you for a start and goal board configuration. Simply enter those as a string when 
# prompted to. The program will try to solve the puzzle. If the puzzle is unsolvable or it takes too long it will output no solution.
# Most solvable puzzles the program will solve (up to 30 moves).  If the puzzle is solvable, the program will output the number of moves
# and the solution as specified in the assignment description. The program will then prompt you if you want to continue and will provide
# instructions on doing so.
