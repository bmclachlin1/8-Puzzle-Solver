# This is a project I did for a data structures and algorithms class in my fourth semester of school. In this project, I implemented the A* search algorithm to solve the 8-Puzzle problem. The data structure used is a priority queue (min-heap implementation).

# Instructions are given when the program is run for what to enter. The program assumes that the string entered by the user represents a 3x3 board tile in row-major order. The string entered must contain the digits 0-8, without any of the digits repeating.
